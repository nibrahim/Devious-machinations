* What Is S5?
** It's a Simple Standards-based Slide Show System
** One XHTML document provides all of the slide show's content
** CSS handles the layout and look of the slides
** JavaScript handles the dynamic aspects of the show
** That's all there is to it!
* Operatic Origins
** Opera 4 introduced [[http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/operashow/][Opera Show]], a projection-mode style sheet technology (link demonstrates external link styling and window spawning)
** Allows a single XHTML document to be turned into a PowerPoint-like slide show
** Adding screen and print style sheets allows for multi-medium views of a single document
** Highly efficient, but highly browser centric...
* Incremental Display                                   :Incremental:ShowFirst:
** Keep hitting/clicking "next" as long as it isn't the control link (»)
** Bullet points are revealed one by one                          :Incremental:
*** All based on class name of =inc=
*** Lists can be classed to make items appear individually
*** Individual items can be classed as well to create "animations"; see [[http://boxofchocolates.ca/projects/s5-incremental-graphics/][Derek Featherstone's example]]
** Let's try it again, but without the first bullet point being pre-highlighted...
* Incremental Display II                                          :Incremental:
** Keep hitting/clicking "next" as long as it isn't the control link (»)
** Bullet points are revealed one by one
*** All based on class name of =incremental=
*** Lists can be classed to make items appear individually
*** Individual items can be classed as well to create "animations"; see [[http://boxofchocolates.ca/projects/s5-incremental-graphics/][Derek Featherstone's example]]
** Notice how the sub-list was part of the parent bullet point; that was done on purpose
** Now to move on to other test slides!
