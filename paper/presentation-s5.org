* Introduction
** Game development is fun.
** Lots of great open source components.
** Let's build a game!
** A clone of the famous [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Machine][TIM]].
* Components : PyGame						:Incremental:
** Simple wrapper around the [[http://www.libsdl.org/][SDL]] library (C).
** Great for sprite based 2D graphics (Solarwolf, Neverwinter nights, Second life)
** Also has routines for sound, event handling etc.
** Fast and cross platform.
** Example : Animation and mouse event handling.
* Components : PyODE						:Incremental:
** Wrapper around the [[http://www.ode.org/][ODE]] library.
** 3D Physics middleware used in commercial games (BloodRayne 2, World of Goo).
** Rigid body dynamics
*** To handle effects of forces on bodies.
*** /Bodies/ interacting in a /world/.
** Collision detection
*** To handle objects touching each other.
*** /Geometries/ interacting in a /space/.
** Example : Lots of balls falling into a pit.
* The Incredible Machine 
** Strategy game by Jeff Tunnell (1993) published by Dynamix.
** Construct Heath Robinson machines for nonsensical tasks.
** Simple deterministic 2D physics simulation.
** Gameplay.
* Devious machinations
** Our clone of TIM
** One level

*** Drop the tennis ball into the wicker basket.
*** You have a few levers and 2 extra balls.
* Devious machinations : code
** Let's look through some source code.
